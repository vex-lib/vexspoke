;;DEFINITION
/**
 * ============================================================================
 * DEFINITION: StructExhaustion
 * ============================================================================
 * The one loud-refusal seam for finite-storage owners that do not embed a
 * Collection (MinHeap, SparseSet, Octree, ...). A refusal is counted every time
 * and reported once per epoch: the first refusal emits a THROW naming the owner
 * and the requested size, later ones only increment (the Exhaustion Loudness
 * Law). The owner owns the two state words; this module owns the policy, so the
 * count-and-report rule cannot drift between owners.
 * ============================================================================
 */

;;OVERVIEW
/**
 * ============================================================================
 * MODULE: StructExhaustion (struct/exhaustion)
 * ============================================================================
 * PROCEDURAL — no owned class. State lives in the calling owner (a refusal
 * count plus a one-report latch, passed by pointer).
 *
 * FUNCTION REGISTRY:
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Core Functions:
 *   - Struct_reportExhaustion(count, reported, owner, requestedBytes)
 *   - Struct_exhaustionCount(count)
 *   - Struct_resetExhaustion(count, reported)
 *
 * CONTRACT: count/reported must point at live owner storage. A null pair is a
 * caller defect and is reported rather than silently ignored. Always returns
 * false; the caller still returns its own safe default.
 * ============================================================================
